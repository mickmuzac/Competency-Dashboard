	<!--In this section do not use URIs that attempt to represent the competency levels with parent-child strings. It is more flexible to keep them all at the same level. That allows more interoperability for competencies. For example, "Create a Python variable with accompanying parameters" is a competency that applies to programming in many programming languages, not just Python. This competency could be reused (if "Python" was taken out) for those contexts, but not if it is a child object of "adlnet.gov/competency-framework/v1/create-edit-pYthon-competency-framework". Also, there is no particular reason to assign hierarchical folder levels to them in the resident file directory. Putting them all at the same level provides flexibility in changing their hierarchy order later. The hierarchy is defined above in the <SupportingInformation> tag if anyone wants to see that. The <lom:description> field does allow the option of describing the hierarchy also (not used for that in this file). What you see in the items below is anything that is a child object of the competency defined in the file you are currently looking at. Other than what is described in the <SupportingInformation> or <lom:description> tags, you cannot tell unless you go into one of those files whether it is a leaf node ("competency object") or parent of other nodes ("competency framework").-->
